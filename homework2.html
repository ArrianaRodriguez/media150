    <h1>Homework #2 -- Cropping & Resizing + Tonal Range</h1>
<br>
<p>I had chosen to take these two photos because they have a stark contrast between the community, the vibrant and crowded shot of the hunter skybridge – to isolation with the dark, blurry, and empty shot of a stairwell. I also liked the contrast between the warm colors shown in the skybridge photo, and the much cooler to grayscale tone taken in the stairwell. The subject –or more so the main theme– can be travel as students are seen walking together from one section of the building to another, and well as people below driving in their cars compared to the single individual that is travelling up the staircase alone.
