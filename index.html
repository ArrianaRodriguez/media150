<p>Hello! My name is Arriana Rodriguez. I'm a graduate from the High School of Art & Design. I enjoy being a cartoonist, doodling things and even sculpting tiny clay pieces in my free time. I specifically enjoy working on digital mediums, so working on website designs seems like a fun challenge!</p>
