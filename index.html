<p>Hello! My name is Arriana Rodriguez. I'm a graduate from the High School of Art & Design.
     I enjoy being a cartoonist, doodling things and even sculpting tiny clay pieces 
     in my free time. I specifically enjoy working on digital mediums, so working on 
     website designs seems like a fun challenge! I am also highly interested in 
     learning how to animate, and I'm hoping I can use my previous knowledge in 
     digital art to transition from still artworks to moving frames that catch the 
     viewers attention. Companies such as Disney, Glitch Productions, and Nintendo 
     have inspired me throughout the years to carry out this goal!</p>
