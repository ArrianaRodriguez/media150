    <h1>Reading1: "In Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag</h1>
    <br>
    <p>As I read through In Plato’s Cave by Susan Sontag– I noticed they challenge the way we consume photographs and force readers to reconsider the emotional backstories or implications of looking at images of suffering. Sontag also argues that photographs shape our understanding of reality while at the same time, distancing us from it. What struck me most about the essay is her claim that photography does not simply document the world but actively alters how we feel, remember, and respond to it. Sontag suggests that photographs give us the illusion of knowledge. By seeing an image, we feel as though we understand an event, even if we lack context or any personal experience. This idea feels especially relevant today, when images circulate constantly through social media and news platforms. We scroll past photos of war going on in certain places, poverty, disaster, and many other current world events so frequently that they begin to blur together. Sontag warns that repeated exposure to such images can numb our response to bizarre scenery rather than inspiring action upon their viewers. I found this unsettling because it made me question whether looking at these images truly makes me more informed—or more unphased by suffering at a distance. Another powerful point in the essay is Sontag’s discussion of how photographs creatively show things like pain. Even images meant to provoke outrage or sympathy can become visually pleasing, turning real human suffering into something that is enjoyed without understanding its true meaning. It makes me wonder if photographers go on exploiting pain for things like political impact? Sontag seems to leave this up to interpretation which makes her argument feel more honest than her trying to enforce action herself.. Personally, as I take photographs every now and then, I never stopped to consider how a photograph is capable of invoking emotion. I more-so focus solely on trying to capture the subject In motion. I believe I could possibly fuse together drawing with photography to help show deeper meanings or successfully have the viewer feel a certain way. In the past, I’ve done this for a school project of mine– and I hope I will be able to do this more often.</p>
