    <h1> "With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster" by Nesrine Malik </h1>
<br>
<p>   In “AI Slop Distorting Our Reality, the World Is Sleepwalking into Disaster,” Nesrine Malik warns about the growing problem of AI-generated content across social media. She argues that the danger isn’t just fake photos or videos, but the huge amount of low-quality AI content flooding the internet. This “AI slop”, as she calls it, is slowly changing how we see and understand the world as we know it. After reading her article, I started to think more carefully about how much of what I see online might not even be created by real people– solely by typing in a few prompts into a website. One of Malik’s main points is that the problem with AI content is not always obvious deception. Instead, it’s the constant barrage of articles, images, and posts that look real but are made by machines. When so much content is produced quickly and cheaply, it becomes harder to tell what is real and what is not. This can weaken our trust in what we read and see online. I think this is an important point because trust is necessary for a healthy society. If we cannot trust information, it becomes difficult to make good decisions. Malik also explains that companies and websites often care more about profit and attention than quality. AI makes it easier to create large amounts of content at little time and cost. Because of this, businesses may choose AI over real, professional human writers or artists. This not only affects jobs, but it also lowers the overall quality of content online. Platforms reward content that gets clicks and views, even if it is not meaningful or accurate. Malik suggests that AI is making an already broken system worse. The word “sleepwalking” in the title stood out to me. It suggests that people are not fully aware of the danger. Many of us scroll through social media without thinking about where the content truly comes from. I realized that I rarely question whether something was made by a person or a computer— AI has evolved so well to where it can hide in plain-sight. Not to mention AI content is often convenient and easy to consume depending on its target audience, so it is tempting to accept it and view it as it is without suspicion. Malik believes this seemingly harmless behavior allows the problem to slowly grow. However, I also wonder if people will eventually adapt to this massive change to the media. In the past, new technologies like television and social media caused problems, but society learned how to handle them and generously accept it all the way into the present time. Maybe laws will even be created to regulate AI usage. And even so, Malik’s warning feels serious and in-the-moment. The speed at which AI is developing makes this situation different from past accomplishments.

    Overall, Malik’s article serves as a wake-up call. She encourages readers to pay attention and think critically about the content they consume. AI itself is not necessarily evil, It’s a revolutionary tool that can be used so far as to save lives in different industries! But, the way it is being used could harm our sense of reality. After reading her essay, I feel even more aware of how important it is to question information that we consume and value real human creativity. If we do not stay alert, we risk letting technology shape our world in harmful ways if let into the wrong hands.
